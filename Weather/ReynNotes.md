Looks really nice. I like the colors a lot.
I realize you are just getting started, so don't take this a criticism, just more like thinking aloud. In my mind, pressure, wind speed, precipitation probability should all be on a chart. People us those things to plan activities, so they want to look over time and see what the weeks going to look like. Humidity is one of those things that only really matter at the moment, so that's fine in a little tile.
The low and high of the day on separate lines looks a little confusing. Why not plot the predicted temperature for the given time, and keep the high/low at the top. The "prediction" for high of the day doesn't really change as the day proceeds.
Keep up the good work
